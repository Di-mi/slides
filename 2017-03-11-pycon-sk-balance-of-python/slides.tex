        Paul Graham provided a list of things that make Lisp different.

        Two of them are already in C and C++.

        Java added just a few more of these.

        Python adds quite a lot more – you could say it dragged Java programmers
        \emph{another half-way} to Lisp.
        (Yes, Python's technically newer than Java, but I'm looking at
        Python 2.5 or so here.)

        Do we want to go the \emph{rest of the way}, and become Lisp?

C gives you functions, values, structures, and pointers.

Java gives you objects and methods, and \emph{not too much else}.

C++ gives you *, \emph{exceptions}, lots of \emph{different concepts} to play with.

Lisp gives you \emph{functions and macros}, just a few basic building blocks,
but ones you can build any of the above with.

\tiny
In C, you tend to build everything \emph{from scratch}, but you have lots of \emph{control}
over everything.

In Java – well, this is \emph{not a real acronym}.
Who here studied database normal forms?

Basically, you have to adapt all behavior to fit the model of objects
and named methods, sometimes in ways that feel \emph{contrived and impractical}
to Python programmers.
And similar behavior is grouped into \emph{design patterns} – different ways to use
the object model.

In C++, there's \emph{just too much} for a person to keep in mind.
Some programmers \emph{limit} themselves to a subset of C++ – for example, they use
references rather than pointers, or they disable exceptions.
That works – until you have to use a \emph{library} that makes \emph{different choices}.

In Lisp, you solve a problem by first \emph{building a language} to solve similar
problems, and then you write a rivial script in that language.
It's quite elegant, but it forces everyone to be a \emph{language designer}.
And language design is hard.

In Python, when a \emph{large part of the community} has a problem that is \emph{impractical}

This is quite rare, and the \emph{discussions} involved are \emph{excruciating}.
The new feature needs to work well with all of the rest of the language.

language, but also \emph{libraries are empowered} to use it.

    The other part of readability is \emph{typography} – the layout of text on a page.
    Here, Python takes a lot of inspiration from printed books as well.

    \emph{PEP8}, the style guide, tells us to
    put a space after a comma, separate function definitions with a certain
    number of blank lines, use lowercase names with underscores,
    limit line length, and avoid up very long lines.

    Typography rules – except for whitespace in indentation – are not \emph{hard rules}.
    It's not part of the syntax. You can \emph{break} these.
